# minifaker

An alternative to faker.js

## npm

`npm i minifaker`

## why

faker.js is too big and there is no tree shaking.
<https://github.com/Marak/faker.js/issues/785>

### why not create a pull request?

Would be to exhaustive to create a big pull request for tree shaking. I'll be adding more functions from time to time.

## how to use

```ts

```

## faker.js support

|Function|Locales|Replaced by|
